# -Brain-Tumor-Detection-ML
Brain tumors, caused by abnormal cell growth, are detected in this study using MRI scans and classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Gradient Boosting. With HOG and LBP for feature extraction, Random Forest achieves 97% accuracy with 5-fold CV.l
